#### Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to better prepare the company for the future by better understanding who is likely to retire in the near future. This was accomplished by doing a deep analysis of the company's employees nearing retirement age, finding how many employees within each department, and at each level of the company were likely to retire soon. 

### Results
- Pewlett Hackard has a total of 90,398 employees that are considered retirement-ready employees by our criteria.
- Senior Engineers and Senior Staff constitute a majority of the company's retirement ready employees, accounting for 57,668 of the 90,398 retirement-ready employees.

-Pewlett Hackard currently has a record of 1,940 employees eligible for the company's mentorship program (criteria: employee born in 1965)
-The actual number of employees eigible for the mentorship program according to this criteria is lower than 1,940 as some of the employees included are no longer working at Pewlett Hackard. 

## Summary
-It cannot be certain exactly when each of the 90,398 retirement-ready employees will truly retire, but it is safe to infer that there will be a substantial number of roles to be filled in the near future. 
-Although the current estimate of mentor-eligible employees overstates the amount of employees Pewlett Hackard has that were born in 1965 (their criteria for being mentorship eligible), I still believe there are enough employees to mentor the future of the company. To begin, there are only 9 departments that need mentors, so it is probable there would be enough mentor-eligible employees to cover each of the departments. Furthermore, the criteria used to determine mentorship eligibility (employee born in 1965) is quite strict, and be relaxing those parameters even slightly, the number of mentorship-eligible candidates would rise considerably.
